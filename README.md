# finallab

## Step 1. Getting started

Open up your terminal.

Make sure node and npm are working. Run the following commands:

```bash
node --version
```

It should display version 14.x (or 16.x).

```bash
npx --version
```

Any version means it is installed.

If these are not installed install the latest version of node.
  
## Step 2. Create and Launch the React project

In your terminal, make a directory for your projects, and change directory to it. I like to keep my files in a directory named `ctp` under my home directory.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir finallab
cd finallab
```

```bash
npx create-react-app finallab
cd finallab
npm start
```

If your browser opened up automatically and you see the spinning logo, then everything is working.
